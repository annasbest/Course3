# Course3: Getting and Cleaning Data by John Hopkins -- Final project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.
